## Understanding
1. Line 1-14: We need the #include for butano to work.
2. Line 17: This is the fixed speed of the green square we control.
3. Line 20-21: This is for the size of the green square the player controls and the size of the
   circle that represents the treasure.
4. Line 24-27: Full bounds of the screen, the minimum and maximum for the display.
5. Line 30: The maximum amount of pixels used to display the score as an integer.

7. Line 40: the variable represents a random variable that will be used for the location of the treasure when the user reaches it.
8. Line 43-44: A vector holds the sprites for the score integer values and the sprite text generator displays the score on the
   screen.

10. Line 53-59: Basically the code for the controls.
