# Collect That Bounty!

Description ~
Collect treasure but watch out for obstacles! Don't want to run into them and get hurt. For each bounty you collect, the layout will change so watch for the obstacles unexpectedly appearing beside you. You're also granted 3 skip boosts, but used them wisely. Once they're out, you can't get them back. If you get hit with no treasure in hand, then it's game over.
